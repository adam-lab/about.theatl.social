Where are your servers located? Are they in Atlanta?
theATL.social operates on the DigitalOcean &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; computing provider, running in a data center in New York City (technically New Jersey).
The choice of provider and data center is due to cost and availability of services. With additional funding, closer data centers to Atlanta may be utilized (for example, the AWS Atlanta local zone).
Can I create an account on behalf of my business, non-profit organization, or representing any other group?</description>
