## Background

Mastodon server costs comprise payment for cloud-based servers, object storage, bandwidth, logging/monitoring, and other auxillary costs. As the number of users on a server increase, the cost per user decreases - an economy of scale.


## Current Costs

Cost and revenue transparency is provided via a frequently updated [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQqsQ6xgILcELj6d3fnAvrXycyw7_E9d6GtmdI-8W3M/edit?usp=sharing).

- For information security purposes, some details in the cost spreadsheet are redacted. 

## Full-Text Search (Elastic Search)

The server does not currently implement full-text search of posts, due to cost.

To implement a robust search capacity, approximately $100-125/month would be needed. These funds would purchase a two-node ElasticSearch cluster to provide the full-text service.

## Legal Organization

The server does not currently operate under a legal organization (e.g., a for-profit or non-profit corporation). Should the server continue expansion, an organization may be established under which the server operates.
