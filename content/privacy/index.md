3. DMs are currently stored in clear text in theATL.social database. If a user from another server is mentioned in a DM, that server will similarly retain a copy of the DM conversation.
4. __Do not post any private, sensitive or otherwise proprietary information to theATL.social, or any other Mastodon instance.__
