1. _Where are your servers located? Are they in Atlanta?_

   - theATL.social operates on the DigitalOcean "cloud" computing provider, running in a data center in New York City (technically New Jersey).

   - The choice of provider and data center is due to cost and availability of services. With additional funding, closer data centers to Atlanta may be utilized (for example, the AWS Atlanta local zone).

2. _Can I create an account on behalf of my business, non-profit organization, or representing any other group?_

    - Yes. There are no restrictions on who can create an account. Note that the server rules apply regardless of account ownership.

3. _Is the site biased towards any particular political party, interest, issue, etc...?_

    - While site admins may express political opinions in their personal capacity, moderation of the site occurs without favor or prejudice towards any partisan interest, issue stance, religion, or any other factor.
    - Content will only be moderated on the basis of compliance with server rules, and not on the agreement or disagreement of any opinion of theATL.social moderators.

4. Who runs the server?

    - [Michael](https://mikeh.dev) here. Pleasure to meet ya üëã
