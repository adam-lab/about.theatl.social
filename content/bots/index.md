## About

"Bots" are accounts on theATL.social that automatically post news stories or timely information, based on updates to web pages or [RSS](https://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/RSS) feeds.

Suggestions and feedback? Send a DM or mention [@michael@theatl.social](https://theatl.social/@michael)

### Update Frequency

Bots are typically update every 30 minutes to 1 hour, daily.

## How to Follow a Bot Account

Search for the account on theATL.social and follow the account. [@michael@theatl.social](https://theatl.social/@michael) will also occasionally publish posts that list bots and content.

## How to Unfollow a Bot Account

Bot accounts are automatically posted to the Local Timelines of theATL.social users. Individual bot accounts may be muted by users. Bot accounts created by the admins also have the hashtag `#theAtlBot` assigned to them. This hashtag may be similarly filtered out from local timelines.

## How to Create a Bot

theATL.social users are welcome to create bots! If you create a bot, please note:

1. Please indicate in the bot's profile that the account is a bot.
2. Please provide an avatar image that best visually describes the bot's purpose.
3. Regarding post frequency and velocity, please avoid "flooding" the local timeline with high-frequency or high-velocity posts.
  
If in doubt, or if you have any questions, please reach out to [@michael@theATL.social](https://theatl.social/@michael) or [@r@theATL.social](https://theatl.social/@r).
